Crazy, cold, and damned, I won't be satisfied
'Til your standing cold and scared
I like you terrified
So tell me what you're waiting for
Don't you wanna be the one who stays alive
A feeling that you can't ignore me creeping up inside
Oh, why do I love a little bit of kiss me, kill me cry
Oh I, oh I love a little bit of kiss me, kill me die
Go on and try, you cannot hide you from me
Why do I
Kiss me, kill me
(Kill me)
Kiss me, kill me
Enter if you dare, don't yet think you've realized
That I'll haunt you 'til the end of your dreadful life
So tell me what you're waiting for
Did you think you'd be the one who could survive
This feeling that you can't ignore me creeping up inside
Oh, why do I love a little bit of kiss me, kill me cry
Oh I, oh I love a little bit of kiss me, kill me die
Go on and try, you cannot hide you from me
Why do I
Kiss me, kill me
(Kill me)
Kiss me kill me die
Try to hide but you're mine
Kiss me, kill me
(Kill me)
Kiss me, kill me
(Kill me)
Kiss me, kill me die
