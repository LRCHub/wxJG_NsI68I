No sympathy for a corrupted heart
A tragic romance
The misery of life until we fall apart
So, here is your chance

Bitter sweet without sympathy
Its truth or dare
The comedy of life, what a tragedy
Why should it be fair?

Kiss me and kill me
Let light fade to dark
Just kiss me and kill me
Kiss me and kill me
Kiss me and kill me
Just kiss me and kill me

(Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss,
Kill, kill, kill, kill,
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss,
Kill, kill, kill, kill)
(Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss,
Kill, kill, kill, kill,
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss,
Kill, kill, kill, kill)

No sympathy for the irony
Of misery and grief
One last kiss, lets die in harmony
I will make you believe

Lets put an end to this atrocity
A crippled heart wont heal
Arms open wide for bad company
So here is the deal

(Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss,
Kill, kill, kill, kill,
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss,
Kill, kill, kill, kill)
(Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss,
Kill, kill, kill, kill,
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss,
Kill, kill, kill, kill)

Kiss me and kill me
Let light fade to dark
Just kiss me and kill me
Kiss me and kill me

Kiss me and kill me
Let light fade to dark
Just kiss me and kill me
Kiss me and kill me

Kiss me and kill me
Let light fade to dark
Just kiss me and kill me
Kiss me and kill me
Kiss me and kill me
Just kiss me and kill me
