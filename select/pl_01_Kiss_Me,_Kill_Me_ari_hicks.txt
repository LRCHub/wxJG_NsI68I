Crazy, cold, and damned,
I won't be satisfied
Till your standing cold
and scared
I like you terrified
So tell me
what your waiting for
Dont you wanna be
the one who stays alive
A feeling that
you can’t ignore
Me creeping up inside
Oh why do i,
love a little bit of kiss me
kill me cry
Oh I, oh I,
love a little bit of kiss me
kill me die
Go on and try you cannot hide
you from me
Why do i
Kiss me kill me
(kill me)
Kiss me kill me die
Enter if you dare,
don’t yet think
you’ve realized
That Ill haunt you till the end
of your dreadful life
So tell me what your
waiting for
Did you think you'd be
the one who could survive
This feeling that
you can't ignore
Me creeping up inside
Oh why do i,
Love a little bit of kiss me
kill me cry
Oh I oh I love a little bit of
kiss me kill me die
Go on and try you cannot hide
you from me
Why do I
Kiss me kill me
(Kill me)
Kiss me kill me die
Try to hide but your mine
Kiss me kill me
(Kill me)
(love a little bit of
kiss me kill me)
(Kill me)
Kiss me kill me die
