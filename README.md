[00:05.26] Crazy, cold and damned
[00:09.85] I won't be satisfied
[00:14.99] 'Til you're standing cold and scared
[00:20.42] I like you terrified
[00:30.42] 
[00:27.76] So tell me what you waiting for
[00:30.47] Don't you want to be the one who stays alive?
[00:33.45] A feeling that you can't ignore
[00:34.97] Been craving up inside
[00:45.97] 
[00:39.20] Oh I, do I love a little bit
[00:42.37] Of kiss me, kill me, cry
[00:44.53] Oh I, oh I love a little bit
[00:47.80] Of kiss me, kill me, die
[00:49.47] Go on and try, you cannot hide you from me
[00:54.15] Why do I?
[00:58.72] Kiss me, kill me
[01:06.72] 
[01:04.80] Kill me
[01:09.46] Kiss me, kill me
[01:17.46] 
[01:10.71] And if you dare
[01:15.08] Don't you think you'll fade at last
[01:20.51] But I'll hunt you 'til the end of your dreadful life
[01:46.51] 
[01:33.16] So tell me what you waiting for
[01:35.98] Did you think you'll be the one who could survive?
[01:38.79] This feeling that you can't ignore
[01:40.67] Been craving up inside
[01:51.67] 
[01:44.50] Oh I, do I love a little bit
[01:47.63] Of kiss me, kill me, cry
[01:50.11] Oh I, oh I love a little bit
[01:53.01] Of kiss me, kill me, die
[01:55.28] Go on and try, you cannot hide you from me
[01:59.90] Why do I?
[02:04.05] Kiss me, kill me
[02:12.05] 
[02:10.25] Kill me
[02:14.95] Kiss me, kill me, die
[02:25.45] 
[02:27.25] Tied, but you're mine
[02:37.75] 
[02:36.88] Kiss me, kill me
[02:43.02] Kill me
[02:47.72] Kiss me, kill me
[02:55.72] 
[02:53.93] Kill me
[02:58.68] Kiss me, kill me, die
